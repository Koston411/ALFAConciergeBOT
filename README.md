ALFA chatbot is a Telegram bot to organise taxi ride between the hotels and event venue.
Someone wants to go from the hotel to the event venue. He can register interest to create a shared ride.
It could be extended to find people to go to the airport and share a ride.

USAGE
1. Start the bot in a shell:
pipenv run python bot.py

2. Add the chatbot in Telegram (@AlfaConciergeBot) and start to interact

TO BE DONE
- Save the taxi created inside a lite SQL DB (sqlalchemy?)
- Retrieve the existing rides from the DB
